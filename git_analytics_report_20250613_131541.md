### Features (11 commits)

- **8c4cce6** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-13 12:29:38: Introduced code health analysis with a new CLI flag, implemented complexity and churn analysis, enhanced reporting, and added tests to validate the feature.

- **8a60a83** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 19:31:15: Finalized documentation and memory for v0.3.0, adding features like code health analysis, contributor analysis, and an automated test suite, while upgrading thematic analysis to AI-powered classification and improving performance through caching.

- **dc2518c** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 18:57:06: This commit introduces a new 'Contributor Analysis' feature, allowing users to generate author-centric summaries in reports via a new `--by-author` CLI flag, and enhances the `ReportBuilder` to support this new data in both Markdown and JSON formats, alongside adding new tests to validate the functionality.

- **aa3bcf0** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 17:43:01: This commit introduces a smart caching system for AI-generated summaries to significantly improve performance for repeated analyses, adds a `--no-cache` flag to bypass the cache, and fixes a bug where dates from cached results were not formatted correctly, which previously caused report generation to fail.

- **b2cadb8** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 17:29:50: This commit introduces a `--branch` option to the `analyze` command, allowing users to specify and analyze any branch, and enhances the `GitAnalyzer` to correctly identify commits unique to the selected branch, thereby improving analysis flexibility and performance.

- **f79b800** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 17:15:13: Thematic analysis was upgraded from a rule-based system to a more robust AI-powered classification system, enhancing accuracy and summary quality by providing detailed category descriptions to the AI prompt, which allows the tool to reliably categorize commits from any repository.

- **c4cefb3** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 16:49:13: This commit introduces a comprehensive thematic analysis feature that automatically categorizes commits into themes based on Conventional Commit prefixes, updates the report format to group commits by theme, and integrates several new core components like a code-aware AI summarizer, a ReportBuilder, an AISummarizer, a configuration system for API keys, and a GitAnalyzer, while also setting up the initial CLI skeleton and project structure.

- **1885ebc** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 16:44:10: This commit implements code-aware summaries by upgrading the AI summarizer to analyze code diffs alongside commit messages, enhancing the `GitAnalyzer` to extract diffs, and adding a high-level executive summary feature to the `AISummarizer` for more accurate and context-rich reports.

- **4924f5f** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 16:37:02: This commit introduces a new feature to the Git Analytics CLI that generates a high-level executive summary by synthesizing individual commit summaries using an AI, enhancing the reporting capabilities of the tool.

- **a1496c2** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 13:39:08: This commit introduces an AI summarizer feature that uses OpenRouter to generate commit summaries, along with a new configuration system that utilizes a `.env` file and `pydantic-settings` for managing API keys and AI model names, enhancing the tool's functionality and configurability.

- **04a4dc7** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 13:14:43: This commit establishes the initial project structure and implements a basic command-line interface (CLI) skeleton using `click` and `rich`, including a `setup.py` for package installation and an `analyze` command placeholder, to lay the groundwork for the `gitanalytics` application.
