# Progress: Git Analytics CLI

## Current Status: Version 0.2.0 (Productivity Features Complete)

All planned productivity features have been implemented. The tool is now highly capable of generating intelligent, structured, and insightful reports from any Git repository that follows Conventional Commits.

## What Works

- **Complete Project Scaffolding:** Fully initialized project structure, environment, and documentation.
- **Basic CLI:** A working, installable command-line interface.
- **Git Analyzer:** Successfully connects to repositories and extracts commit history and code diffs.
- **AI Summarizer:**
  - Integrates with OpenRouter and manages settings via a `.env` file.
  - Generates code-aware summaries for individual commits.
  - Generates a high-level executive summary for the entire analysis period.
- **Thematic Analyzer:** Automatically categorizes commits based on Conventional Commit prefixes.
- **Report Builder:** Generates and saves themed reports in both Markdown and JSON format.

## What's Left to Build

### Production-Ready Features
-   **Smart Caching (`cache_manager.py`)**: To avoid re-processing commits.
-   **Cost Monitoring (`cost_monitor.py`)**: To track API usage and costs.
-   **Automated Testing (`tests/`)**: A full `pytest` suite.
-   **AI-Powered Classification**: For repositories that don't use Conventional Commits.
-   **Branch Selection**: An option to analyze branches other than the current `HEAD`.

## Known Issues

- None at this time.
