# Progress: Git Analytics CLI

## Current Status: Version 0.3.0 (Planning Production Features)

All planned productivity features, including a robust AI-powered classification system, have been implemented. The focus now shifts to production-readiness features that improve flexibility and performance.

## What Works

- **Complete Project Scaffolding:** Fully initialized project structure, environment, and documentation.
- **Basic CLI:** A working, installable command-line interface.
- **Git Analyzer:** Successfully connects to repositories and extracts commit history and code diffs.
- **AI Summarizer:**
  - Integrates with OpenRouter and manages settings via a `.env` file.
  - Generates code-aware summaries for individual commits.
  - Generates a high-level executive summary for the entire analysis period.
- **AI Classifier:** Intelligently categorizes any commit into a theme (e.g., Features, Fixes) using an AI-powered, single-call approach.
- **Thematic Analyzer:** Automatically categorizes commits based on Conventional Commit prefixes.
- **Report Builder:** Generates and saves themed reports in both Markdown and JSON format.
- **Branch Selection:** An option to analyze branches other than the current `HEAD`.

## What's Left to Build

### Production-Ready Features
-   **Smart Caching (`cache_manager.py`)**: To avoid re-processing commits. *(In Progress)*
-   **Cost Monitoring (`cost_monitor.py`)**: To track API usage and costs.
-   **Automated Testing (`tests/`)**: A full `pytest` suite.

## Known Issues

- None at this time.
