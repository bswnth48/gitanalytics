# Progress: Git Analytics CLI

## Current Status: Day 2 - Core Development Complete

The core analysis engine is feature-complete. The application can now successfully extract data, analyze it with AI, and present the results in the console. The next phase is building the final output generation.

## What Works

- **Complete Project Scaffolding:**
  - The `memory-bank/` is fully initialized.
  - The `uv` virtual environment is created and active.
  - All project dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt`.
  - The full directory and file structure under `src/` is in place.
- **Basic CLI:**
  - A working command-line interface is implemented in `cli.py` using `click`.
  - The package is installable in editable mode via `setup.py`.
  - The `gitanalytics analyze` command is functional with placeholder output.
- **Git Analyzer:**
  - `GitAnalyzer` class in `git_analyzer.py` successfully connects to repositories.
  - Extracts commit history with optional date filtering.
  - Integrated with the CLI, which now displays the number of commits found.
- **AI Summarizer:**
  - Integrates with OpenRouter via the `openai` client.
  - Summarizes commit messages using a user-configurable AI model.
  - Manages API keys and model settings securely via a `.env` file.

## What's Left to Build

- **Report Builder (`report_builder.py`):**
  - Create Markdown and JSON reports from the analyzed data using Jinja2 templates.
  - Save reports to files.

## Known Issues

- None at this time.
