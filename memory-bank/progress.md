# Progress: Git Analytics CLI

## Current Status: Version 0.3.0 (Production-Ready Features Complete)

### Description
All planned production-ready features have been implemented, resulting in a powerful and robust Git analytics tool. The application can perform deep analysis on commits, contributors, and code health, all backed by a comprehensive test suite. The project is now at a stable point, ready for a `v0.3.0` release.

## What Works

- **AI-Powered Thematic Analysis**: Automatically categorizes commits using AI, even in repositories without Conventional Commits.
- **Code-Aware Summaries**: AI generates summaries by analyzing both commit messages and code diffs.
- **High-Level Executive Summary**: Provides a concise overview of the entire analysis period.
- **Smart Caching**: Improves performance by caching AI results.
- **Branch Selection**: Allows analysis of any branch, not just the currently checked-out one.
- **Contributor Analysis**: Generates reports summarizing contributions by author.
- **Code Churn & Complexity Analysis**: Identifies high-churn files and measures their cyclomatic complexity to flag potential technical debt.
- **Comprehensive Automated Testing**: A full `pytest` suite ensures the stability and correctness of all features.
- **Flexible Reporting**: Generates reports in Markdown and JSON formats.
- **Secure Configuration**: Manages API keys and settings securely.

## What's Left to Build

This section tracks ideas and future enhancements.

- **Historical Trend Analysis**: Track key metrics (complexity, churn, commit frequency) over time to visualize project evolution.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Provide a mechanism to run `gitanalytics` in a CI/CD pipeline and fail builds or comment on PRs based on the results.
- **Interactive HTML Reports**: Move beyond Markdown to generate rich, interactive reports with charts and graphs using a library like Plotly or D3.js.
- **Refined AI Prompting**: Further tune the AI prompts for even more accurate and insightful summaries and classifications.
