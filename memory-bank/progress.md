# Progress: Git Analytics CLI

## Current Status: Version 0.1.0 (Implementing Advanced Analytics)

The core MVP is stable. Development is now focused on adding advanced analytical features to enhance the tool's productivity.

## What Works

- **Complete Project Scaffolding:** Fully initialized project structure, environment, and documentation.
- **Basic CLI:** A working, installable command-line interface.
- **Git Analyzer:** Successfully connects to repositories and extracts commit history and code diffs.
- **AI Summarizer:**
  - Integrates with OpenRouter and manages settings via a `.env` file.
  - Generates code-aware summaries for individual commits.
  - Generates a high-level executive summary for the entire analysis period.
- **Report Builder:** Generates and saves clean reports in both Markdown and JSON format.

## What's Left to Build

### Productivity & Analysis Features
1.  **High-Level Executive Summary:** An AI-generated overview of the entire analysis period. *(Done)*
2.  **Code-Aware Summaries:** Analyze the code diffs for each commit. *(Done)*
3.  **Thematic Analysis:** Automatically group commits by type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`). *(In Progress)*

### Production-Ready Features
-   **Smart Caching (`cache_manager.py`)**: To avoid re-processing commits.
-   **Cost Monitoring (`cost_monitor.py`)**: To track API usage and costs.
-   **Automated Testing (`tests/`)**: A full `pytest` suite.
