# Progress: Git Analytics CLI

## Current Status: Day 1 - Core Development

The project has moved from initialization to the core development phase. The foundation is solid, and work on the application's features is beginning.

## What Works

- **Complete Project Scaffolding:**
  - The `memory-bank/` is fully initialized.
  - The `uv` virtual environment is created and active.
  - All project dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt`.
  - The full directory and file structure under `src/` is in place.

## What's Left to Build

The primary focus is on building the core engine. The task list is as follows:
- **CLI (`cli.py`):**
  - Implement main command group.
  - Add options for repository path, date ranges, and output format.
- **Git Analyzer (`git_analyzer.py`):**
  - Connect to a local Git repository.
  - Extract commit objects based on date filters.
- **AI Summarizer (`ai_summarizer.py`):**
  - Integrate with OpenRouter API.
  - Implement summarization logic.
- **Report Builder (`report_builder.py`):**
  - Create Markdown and JSON reports from summaries.

## Known Issues
