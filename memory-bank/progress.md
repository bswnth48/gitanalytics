# Progress: Git Analytics CLI

## Current Status: Day 1 - Core Development

The project has moved from initialization to the core development phase. The foundation is solid, and work on the application's features is beginning.

## What Works

- **Complete Project Scaffolding:**
  - The `memory-bank/` is fully initialized.
  - The `uv` virtual environment is created and active.
  - All project dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt`.
  - The full directory and file structure under `src/` is in place.
- **Basic CLI:**
  - A working command-line interface is implemented in `cli.py` using `click`.
  - The package is installable in editable mode via `setup.py`.
  - The `gitanalytics analyze` command is functional with placeholder output.

## What's Left to Build

The primary focus is on building the core engine. The task list is as follows:
- **Git Analyzer (`git_analyzer.py`):**
  - Connect to a local Git repository.
  - Extract commit objects based on date filters.
  - Return a list of structured commit data.
- **AI Summarizer (`ai_summarizer.py`):**
  - Integrate with OpenRouter API.
  - Implement summarization logic.
- **Report Builder (`report_builder.py`):**
  - Create Markdown and JSON reports from summaries.

## Known Issues

- None at this time.
