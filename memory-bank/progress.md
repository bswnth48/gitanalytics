# Progress: Git Analytics CLI

## Current Status: Version 0.4.0 (Implementing Automated Tests)

All major features are now implemented. The focus is on building a comprehensive test suite to ensure stability and reliability.

## What Works

- **Complete Project Scaffolding:** Fully initialized project structure, environment, and documentation.
- **Basic CLI:** A working, installable command-line interface.
- **Git Analyzer:** Successfully connects to repositories and extracts commit history and code diffs.
- **AI Summarizer & Classifier:** A robust, single-call AI system that generates code-aware summaries and classifies commits, integrated with OpenRouter.
- **Branch Selection:** An option to analyze branches other than the current `HEAD`.
- **Smart Caching:** Caches AI summaries to avoid re-processing commits, with a `--no-cache` override.
- **Cost Monitoring:** Tracks API token usage and provides an estimated cost for each analysis run.
- **Report Builder:** Generates and saves themed reports in both Markdown and JSON format.
- **Automated Test Suite:** A robust `pytest` suite ensures application stability and catches regressions.

## What's Left to Build

### Advanced Analytics
-   **Contributor Analysis**: Summarize contributions by author. *(In Progress)*
-   **Code Churn & Complexity**: Identify hotspots and potential technical debt in the codebase.
-   **HTML Reports**: Generate beautiful, interactive HTML reports.

## Known Issues

- None at this time.
