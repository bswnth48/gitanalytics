# Active Context: Planning Next Phase (Production Readiness)

## Current Focus

All major productivity features (High-Level Summary, Code-Aware Analysis, Thematic Grouping) have been successfully implemented and tested. The current focus is to pause development, review our progress, and plan the next phase, which will likely involve implementing production-ready features like caching and a more robust testing suite.

## Recent Changes

- Successfully implemented and tested "Thematic Analysis".
- The tool now automatically groups commits by their type (e.g., Features, Fixes) based on Conventional Commits prefixes, creating a highly structured and readable report.

## Next Steps

1.  **Address User Questions:** Discuss and document solutions for handling non-conventional commits and analyzing different branches.
2.  **Prioritize Production Features:** Decide on the next feature to implement from the production-readiness roadmap (e.g., Caching, Cost Monitoring, Automated Testing).
3.  **Implement Caching:** The most logical next step is to build the `cache_manager.py` to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls.
