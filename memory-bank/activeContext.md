# Active Context: Project Completion

## Current Focus

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is now feature-complete. The current focus is on finalizing documentation, cleaning up any loose ends, and preparing for a potential version `0.1.0` release.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the `ReportBuilder` class in `src/gitanalytics/report_builder.py`.
- Created a Jinja2 template for clean Markdown report generation.
- Added a method to generate a structured JSON report.
- Integrated the `ReportBuilder` into the CLI, controlled by the `--output` flag.
- Successfully tested the end-to-end report generation for both Markdown and JSON formats.

## Next Steps

1.  **Finalize Documentation:** Update the `README.md` with complete installation and usage instructions.
2.  **Review and Refactor:** Perform a final code review for any potential cleanup or refactoring.
3.  **Tag Release:** Create a `v0.1.0` tag in Git to mark the first stable release.
4.  **Future Enhancements:** Brainstorm and document potential future features (e.g., advanced analytics, more output formats).
