# Active Context: Implement Smart Caching

## Current Focus

Having implemented all core analysis features, our focus now shifts to performance and efficiency. The immediate goal is to implement **Smart Caching**. This will create a local cache of AI-generated summaries to avoid re-processing commits, which will significantly improve speed and solve the API rate-limiting issue we encountered.

## Recent Changes

- Successfully implemented and tested "Branch Selection", allowing the user to analyze any branch in the repository.

## Next Steps

1.  **Create Cache Manager:** Implement a `CacheManager` class in `src/gitanalytics/cache_manager.py` with methods to load, save, and retrieve cached data from a local file.
2.  **Integrate with AI Summarizer:** Modify `AISummarizer` to check the cache for a result before making an API call. If a result is found, use it; otherwise, make the API call and save the new result to the cache.
3.  **Add CLI Option:** Introduce a `--no-cache` flag to the `analyze` command to allow users to bypass the cache and force a fresh analysis.
4.  **Test:** Run the analysis twice on the same repositoryâ€”once to populate the cache, and a second time to verify that it uses the cache and runs much faster.
