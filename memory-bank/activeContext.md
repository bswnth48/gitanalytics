# Active Context: Implement High-Level Executive Summary

## Current Focus

With the core MVP complete, we are now moving on to advanced analytical features. The immediate goal is to implement a "High-Level Executive Summary". This involves making a second AI call to synthesize a narrative summary from the list of individual commit summaries.

## Recent Changes

- Completed and tested the full MVP of the Git Analytics CLI.
- Agreed on a new roadmap for advanced analytical features to make the tool more productive.
- The new roadmap includes: High-Level Summaries, Code-Aware Analysis, and Thematic Grouping.

## Next Steps

1.  **Enhance AI Summarizer:** Add a new method `generate_executive_summary` to `ai_summarizer.py` that takes all individual summaries and prompts an AI to create a high-level overview.
2.  **Update Report Template:** Modify `report.md.j2` to replace the placeholder text with a variable for the new executive summary.
3.  **Update Report Builder:** Adjust `report_builder.py` to accept the executive summary and pass it to the template.
4.  **Update CLI:** Modify `cli.py` to orchestrate the new workflow: get commits -> get individual summaries -> get executive summary -> build report.
5.  **Test:** Run the analysis and verify the new summary appears correctly in the Markdown report.
