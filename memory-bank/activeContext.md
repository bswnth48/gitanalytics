# Active Context: Implement Automated Testing

## Current Focus

With all major features (analysis, caching, cost tracking) now implemented, our focus shifts to ensuring the stability and reliability of the application. The goal is to build a comprehensive **Automated Test Suite** using `pytest`. This will allow us to make future changes with confidence, knowing that the core functionality is protected by tests.

## Recent Changes

- Successfully implemented and tested "Cost Monitoring", which tracks token usage and provides an estimated cost for each analysis run.

## Next Steps

1.  **Setup Test Environment:** Create a `conftest.py` to manage shared testing fixtures, such as creating temporary Git repositories for tests to run against.
2.  **Test Core Logic:**
    -   Write unit tests for the `GitAnalyzer` to ensure it correctly identifies and filters commits.
    -   Write tests for the `CacheManager` to verify saving and loading from the cache.
3.  **Test CLI & Integration:**
    -   Write integration tests for the `analyze` command in `cli.py` using `Click`'s test runner.
    -   Mock the AI API calls to test the application's flow without incurring costs or relying on external services.
4.  **Run Tests:** Execute the full test suite to ensure all components are working as expected.
