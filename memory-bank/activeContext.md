# Active Context: Advanced Analytics - Code Churn & Complexity

## Current Focus
**Planning Next Phase (Advanced Features)**

With the successful implementation of Code Churn & Complexity analysis, all planned "production-ready" features are now complete. The tool is robust, well-tested, and provides deep insights into a repository's history, health, and contributors. We are now in a planning phase to determine the next major direction for the project.

## Recent Changes
- **Code Churn & Complexity Analysis**: Integrated `radon` to calculate cyclomatic complexity and combined it with commit frequency (churn) to generate a "Code Health Summary". This helps identify potential technical debt and high-risk components.
- **Contributor Analysis**: Added a `--by-author` flag to generate reports summarizing contributions by each author, providing insights into team dynamics and individual impact.
- **Automated Testing**: Built a comprehensive test suite using `pytest`, ensuring stability and correctness across all features. Tests cover the CLI, git analysis, complexity calculations, and more.

## Next Steps
1.  **Finalize Documentation**: Review and update all documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, etc.) to reflect the new features and create a stable `v0.3.0` release.
2.  **Explore Advanced Analytics**:
    - **Historical Trend Analysis**: Could we track complexity and churn over time to visualize trends?
    - **CI/CD Integration**: How can this tool be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to provide automated reports on pull requests?
    - **Interactive Reports**: Could we generate HTML reports with interactive charts and graphs?
3.  **Prioritize next feature set** based on user feedback and project goals.
