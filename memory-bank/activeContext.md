# Active Context: Core Development Kickoff

## Current Focus

With the project initialization complete, the focus now shifts to implementing the core application logic. The first step is to build the command-line interface (CLI) entry point using the `click` library.

## Recent Changes

- Project initialization completed.
- Created `memory-bank/` with all core files.
- Set up `uv` virtual environment at `.venv/`.
- Created `requirements.txt` and installed all dependencies.
- Scaffolded the entire project directory and file structure under `src/`.

## Next Steps

1.  **Build the CLI Skeleton:** Implement the main command group and basic commands (e.g., `analyze`) in `src/gitanalytics/cli.py`.
2.  **Implement Git Analyzer:** Develop the logic in `src/gitanalytics/git_analyzer.py` to clone or open a repository and extract commit data.
3.  **Create a `CHANGELOG.md`:** Document all significant changes going forward.
4.  **Create a `README.md`:** Provide a public-facing overview of the project.
5.  **Update Progress:** Continuously update `progress.md` after each major feature is implemented.
