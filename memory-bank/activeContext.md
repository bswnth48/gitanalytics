# Active Context: Report Generation

## Current Focus

The core analysis engine is now complete. The tool can successfully extract commits and use an AI model to generate summaries. The final major step is to implement the `ReportBuilder`. This component will take the analyzed data and format it into user-friendly Markdown or JSON files.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the `AISummarizer` class, which successfully calls the OpenRouter API.
- Added a robust configuration system using a `.env` file and `pydantic-settings` to manage the API key and model name.
- Created a `.gitignore` file to protect the `.env` file.
- Integrated the `AISummarizer` into the CLI.
- Successfully tested the end-to-end workflow, from commit extraction to AI summarization.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Report Builder (`report_builder.py`):**
    - Create a class `ReportBuilder`.
    - Implement a method to generate a Markdown report using a Jinja2 template.
    - Implement a method to generate a JSON report.
2.  **Integrate Report Builder with CLI:** Update `cli.py` to call the `ReportBuilder` based on the `--output` option and save the result to a file.
3.  **Finalize and Document:** Update the `README.md` with final usage instructions and prepare for a version `0.1.0` release.
