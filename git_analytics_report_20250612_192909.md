## Executive Summary

Our Git Analytics CLI tool has seen significant advancements, primarily focusing on AI-powered analysis and enhanced reporting capabilities. Key developments include the integration of AI for thematic analysis and code-aware summaries, a new smart caching system for performance, and flexible analysis options such as branch-specific and contributor-centric reports. These updates, coupled with comprehensive documentation and automated testing, greatly improve the tool's accuracy, usability, and overall value.

### Features (9 commits)

- **aa3bcf0** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 17:43:01: This commit introduces a smart caching system for AI-generated summaries to significantly improve performance for repeated analyses, adds a `--no-cache` flag to bypass the cache, and fixes a bug where dates from cached results were not formatted correctly, which previously caused report generation to fail.

- **b2cadb8** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 17:29:50: This commit introduces a `--branch` option to the `analyze` command, allowing users to specify and analyze any branch, and enhances the `GitAnalyzer` to correctly identify commits unique to the selected branch, thereby improving analysis flexibility and performance.

- **f79b800** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 17:15:13: Thematic analysis was upgraded from a rule-based system to a more robust AI-powered classification system, enhancing accuracy and summary quality by providing detailed category descriptions to the AI prompt, which allows the tool to reliably categorize commits from any repository.

- **c4cefb3** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 16:49:13: This commit introduces a comprehensive thematic analysis feature that automatically categorizes commits into themes based on Conventional Commit prefixes, updates the report format to group commits by theme, and integrates several new core components like a code-aware AI summarizer, a ReportBuilder, an AISummarizer, a configuration system for API keys, and a GitAnalyzer, while also setting up the initial CLI skeleton and project structure.

- **1885ebc** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 16:44:10: This commit implements code-aware summaries by upgrading the AI summarizer to analyze code diffs alongside commit messages, enhancing the `GitAnalyzer` to extract diffs, and adding a high-level executive summary feature to the `AISummarizer` for more accurate and context-rich reports.

- **4924f5f** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 16:37:02: This commit introduces a new feature to the Git Analytics CLI that generates a high-level executive summary by synthesizing individual commit summaries using an AI, enhancing the reporting capabilities of the tool.

- **a1496c2** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 13:39:08: This commit introduces an AI summarizer feature that uses OpenRouter to generate commit summaries, along with a new configuration system that utilizes a `.env` file and `pydantic-settings` for managing API keys and AI model names, enhancing the tool's functionality and configurability.

- **04a4dc7** by bswnth48 on 2025-06-12 13:14:43: This commit establishes the initial project structure and implements a basic command-line interface (CLI) skeleton using `click` and `rich`, including a `setup.py` for package installation and an `analyze` command placeholder, to lay the groundwork for the `gitanalytics` application.
